# LC-2K Sublime Text Plugin

LC-2K syntax highlighting and autocompletion for Sublime Text 3

## Intro

The LC-2K is the "Little Computer 2K" architecture for a computer. 
The LC-2K ISA supports 8 basic instructions and allows for full functionality of a computer.

The LC-2K ISA is used by students of the "EECS 370: Computer Architecture" course at
the University of Michigan. Students also learn the popular [MIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_instruction_set) ISA.

There is already a [Sublime Text Plugin for the MIPS ISA](https://github.com/contradictioned/mips-syntax),
but not for LC-2K. So I decided to make one.

## Installation

**Note: This plugin has only been tested on [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)**
